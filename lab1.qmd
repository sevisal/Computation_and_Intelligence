# Session objectives

::: {.objective-card}
🎯 **General objective:**  
Get familiar with the **Orange Data Mining** tool and learn how to explore and handle data before applying models.
:::

![](images/orange.jpg){.img-right}
Orange Data Mining lets you build visual workflows to analyze data, explore relationships between variables, and prepare datasets for modeling.  
It is a free software platform aimed at teaching and experimenting with data science and machine learning.
Its intuitive graphical interface allows dragging and connecting widgets to perform tasks like loading data, visualization, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluating results without programming.  
Orange also offers extensions for advanced analysis, text mining, bioinformatics, and interactive visualizations, facilitating learning and exploration of modern AI techniques.

In this session we will focus on:

- Learning to navigate Orange's interface and main widget categories.
- Loading and inspecting real datasets.
- Identifying and classifying variable types in the data.
- Visualizing distributions and relationships between variables to discover patterns.
- Selecting relevant features and tailoring the analysis.
- Detecting common data issues such as missing values or inconsistencies.

These skills are fundamental for exploratory analysis and preparing data before applying machine learning algorithms.

**Let's get started!**

2. Connect the **File** widget to the **Data Table** widget to view the dataset.
3. Inspect the columns (attributes), rows (instances), and variable types in the dataset.
4. Connect the **File** widget to the **Data Info** widget to get a dataset summary, including number of rows, columns, variable types, and missing values.  

This initial exploration will help you get familiar with loading and viewing data in Orange, and identify potential problems that could affect later analysis.

::: {.question-card}
📝 **Questions:**  

1. How many columns and rows does the dataset have?
2. What types of variables (categorical, numerical) can you identify?
3. What is the purpose of the target variable in this analysis?
4. Are there missing or inconsistent values in the data? How did you identify them?
5. Why is it important to review the data before applying models?

## 3. Classifying variable types

::: {.objective-card}
🎯 **Objective:** Distinguish categorical variables, numerical variables, and the target variable.
:::

![Figure: Counting error](images/counting.gif){.img-right}
In this activity you will identify and classify variable types in the dataset, distinguishing between categorical, numerical, and the target (__target__) variables. This is essential to understand how data can be used in machine learning models and to correctly choose the variable you want to predict.

Steps:

1. Inspect the dataset in the **Data Table** widget and review each column.
2. Use the **Data Info** widget to obtain a summary of variable types (categorical, numerical, etc.).
3. Analyze column names and values to identify which could be the target variable.

::: {.question-card}
📝 **Questions:**  

1. Which variables are categorical and which are numerical in the dataset?  
2. What problems might arise if you select a different variable as the target?  
3. How does the choice of target variable affect the type of model you can apply later?

## 4. Visualizing distributions

::: {.objective-card}
🎯 **Objective:** Explore how variable values are distributed.
:::

Now you will visualize variable distributions to better understand their behavior and characteristics. This helps identify patterns, trends, and potential issues like class imbalance.

Start by:

1. Drag the **Distributions** widget to the canvas and connect it to **File** or **Select Columns**.
2. Select a numerical variable to see its histogram and a categorical variable to see its bar chart.
3. Observe distribution shapes, outliers, and category frequencies.
4. Repeat for several important variables, including the target variable.
5. Try the **Feature Statistics** widget for additional insights.

::: {.question-card}
📝 **Questions:**  

1. Which variables seem most relevant?  
2. How does class imbalance affect model training?
3. What do you observe about outliers in numerical variables?  
4. How can variable distributions influence preprocessing and modeling choices?

Finally, it's essential to detect and handle common data issues like missing values, inconsistencies, or errors. These problems can negatively affect analysis and model building if not addressed.

Using the `heart_disease.tab` dataset, follow these steps:

1. Drag the **Data Info** widget to the canvas and connect it to **File** or **Select Columns**.
2. Review the dataset summary provided by **Data Info**, paying attention to:
     - Number of rows and columns.
     - Variable types.
     - Missing or inconsistent values.
3. Identify any potential problems in the data.
4. Consider strategies to handle these issues, such as filling missing values, removing rows or columns, or transforming data.
