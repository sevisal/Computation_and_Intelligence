# Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following:

- **Miniconda** or **Anaconda** installed.  
  ðŸ‘‰ You can download it from: [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).
- Access to a terminal: *Anaconda Prompt* (on Windows) or a regular terminal (Linux/macOS).

# Step 1: Create the `orange3-env.yml` File

To make the installation reproducible, we will use a Conda environment file.  

1. Open any text editor such as **Notepad**, **VS Code**, or **Sublime Text**.  
2. Copy the following content into a new file:

```yaml
name: orange3
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - python=3.9
  - attrs
  - orange3
  - lightfm
  - opencv
  - scikit-image
  - nltk
  - spacy
  - scikit-surprise
  - orange3-recommendation
```

3. Save the file as **`orange3-env.yml`** in a location you can easily find.

---

# Step 2: Create the Conda Environment

Now, we will use the `.yml` file to create the environment.

1. Open your terminal (or Anaconda Prompt on Windows).  
2. Navigate to the folder where you saved the file:

```bash
cd path/to/your/file
```

3. Run the following command to create the environment:

```bash
conda env create -f orange3-env.yml
```

---

# Step 3: Activate the Environment

Once the environment is created, activate it with:

```bash
conda activate orange3
```

---

# Step 4: Launch Orange3

Finally, to start Orange3, simply run:

```bash
orange-canvas
```

This command will open the Orange3 graphical user interface. ðŸŽ‰

# Notes & Tips

- If you already had an environment named `orange3`, Conda may ask you to remove or update it.  
- The included libraries (e.g., `lightfm`, `scikit-surprise`, `spacy`) are optional but useful for labs in recommender systems and NLP.  
- You can always remove the environment later with:
  ```bash
  conda remove --name orange3 --all
  ```
